# ReplOS Theme

This repository contains the files for the GTK theme and sounds for ReplOS.

Only the "gtk", "gtksourceview", "icons", and "sounds" components are maintained
as a part of ReplOS; the rest are simply pulled in from the upstream Yaru source
for simplicity, and are not actively used in the distribution. The "gnome-shell"
folder is maintained within the ReplOS/shell repository.
